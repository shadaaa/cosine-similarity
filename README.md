# Cosine Similarity using TF-IDF
This repository provides an implementation of cosine similarity using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for text similarity measurement. Cosine similarity is a metric used to determine how similar two vectors are, particularly in the context of text data.

# Overview
Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them. In the context of text data, each document is represented as a vector where each dimension corresponds to a unique term in the corpus, and the value represents the TF-IDF score of that term in the document.

# TF-IDF
TF-IDF is a numerical statistic that reflects the importance of a term in a document relative to a collection of documents. It consists of two main components:

Term Frequency (TF): Measures the frequency of a term in a document. It is calculated as the ratio of the count of a term to the total number of terms in the document.
Inverse Document Frequency (IDF): Measures the importance of a term across the entire corpus. It is calculated as the logarithm of the ratio of the total number of documents to the number of documents containing the term.
TF-IDF score for a term in a document is obtained by multiplying its TF and IDF values.

# Cosine Similarity
Cosine similarity between two vectors A and B is calculated as the cosine of the angle between them, defined as:

cosine_similarity
(𝐴,𝐵) = 𝐴 ⋅ 𝐵 / ∥𝐴∥ ⋅∥𝐵∥
where ,
A⋅B represents the dot product of vectors A and B, and 
∥A∥ and ∥B∥ represent the Euclidean norms of vectors A and B, respectively.
